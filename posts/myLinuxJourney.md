# My Linux Journey

## First Encounter with Linux

My first experience with Linux was back in grade 9, but I had no idea what it really was. My first laptop came with Ubuntu pre-installed, but since I wasn’t familiar with it, I quickly replaced it with Windows. For a long time, I stuck with Windows, occasionally experimenting with various Linux distributions but never making the full switch.

## The Decision to Switch

In 2021, I finally decided to transition from Windows to Linux as my main operating system. Before making the switch, I did extensive research on different Linux distributions, Linux philosophy, and the open-source ecosystem. After careful consideration, I installed **Manjaro KDE** as my daily driver. This marked the first time I completely replaced Windows with Linux on my main device.

## Exploring Customization

As I got comfortable with Manjaro, I began customizing my system to enhance my workflow. My first major customization involved making my Linux setup look and feel like macOS. This was my entry point into the world of Linux customization, and I quickly realized how much flexibility Linux provides compared to proprietary operating systems.

## Diving into Tiling Window Managers

Before switching to tiling window managers, I experimented with various desktop environments such as **XFCE, GNOME, and other DEs** to find the best fit for my workflow. Eventually, I discovered **tiling window managers** and became interested in their workflow. This led me to switch from Manjaro to **Arch Linux**, where I built my own setup using **BSPWM**. Since Arch only provides a barebones system after installation, I had to configure everything manually. This process deepened my understanding of Linux and how operating systems work at a system level.

During this time, I learned a lot about **X11**, the display server protocol that powered my setups. However, I eventually wanted a more modern look and feel, which led me to explore Wayland.

## The Customization Rabbit Hole

My journey didn't stop there. After using BSPWM for a while, I decided to wipe my system and start fresh with **Qtile** on Arch. This was my third major customization, and by this point, I had fully embraced the endless possibilities of Linux customization.

Eventually, I got a new laptop, which I still use today. On this machine, I installed Arch Linux with **Hyperland**, my first experience with a Wayland compositor. I immediately fell in love with the smooth and modern experience that Wayland provides, fixing many of the issues I faced with X11.

## My Current Setup

Now, my Linux setup is fully customized to match my workflow, making it productive and minimal. Over the years, I have experimented with many distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora, before settling on Arch. I also use a variety of software daily to enhance my workflow:

- **Web & Communication**: Firefox, Ferdium, Breve
- **Media & Productivity**: FreeTube, MPV, Blanket, Super Productivity
- **Development & Tools**: Alacritty, Kitty, VSCode, Neovim (NvChad), VirtualBox, Virt-Manager
- **File & Security**: PCManFM, lf file manager, KeePassXC, LibreOffice, Zathura, Xournal++, LocalSend

## The Future

My journey with Linux is far from over. I continue to refine my setup, experiment with new tools, and explore different ways to improve my workflow. Linux has not only given me a better computing experience but has also deepened my understanding of how operating systems work. I look forward to sharing more about my setups and customizations in future blog posts.

If you're considering switching to Linux, my advice is simple: **just start**. The open-source world has a lot to offer, and the freedom to customize your system exactly how you want is an experience worth having.
