## üåÖ The Problem: When Hospital Lights Hurt Recovery

Hospitals are meant to be healing environments‚Äîbut harsh, cold lighting often works against recovery. Most facilities use static fluorescent lights 24/7, ignoring how light affects our **circadian rhythm** and overall health.

Our circadian rhythms‚Äîour internal 24-hour biological clock‚Äîare primarily regulated by light exposure. In nature, we're exposed to cool, blue-enriched light during the day and warm, dim light in the evening. This natural pattern helps regulate sleep, hormone production, and countless other biological processes.

Hospital lighting, however, tells a different story. Static, bright fluorescent lights shine at the same intensity and color temperature 24/7, creating an environment that actively disrupts patients' circadian rhythms.

Disrupted circadian rhythms in patients and staff can lead to:

- Poor sleep quality  
- Longer recovery times  
- Higher stress and medication needs  
- Compromised immune function

Light isn‚Äôt just visual‚Äî**it‚Äôs biological**. And in hospitals, it often becomes a hidden health risk.

## üí° Our Vision: Smart Lighting That Supports Healing

**CircadiaLux** is our answer: a smart, adaptive lighting system that uses **machine learning**, **IoT devices**, and **cloud technology** to create lighting environments that:

- Mimic natural daylight cycles  
- Personalize lighting based on age, condition, and chronotype  
- Respond to real-time environmental feedback  

CircadiaLux is not just a lighting control system‚Äîit‚Äôs a biologically informed platform for **circadian alignment and healing**.

## üîÑ Why Lighting Matters in Healthcare

![CircadianLux Flow Diagram: Lighting Settings ‚Üí Circadian Rhythm ‚Üí Sleep ‚Üí Healing](/circadialux/process.png)

> **Lighting directly influences circadian rhythms, which in turn affect sleep quality‚Äîand ultimately, the healing process.**

This chain is the core of our approach:

1. **Lighting Settings**  
2. Influence **Circadian Rhythm**  
3. Which determines **Sleep Quality**  
4. Directly impacting the **Healing Process**

By optimizing the first link ( light ) we improve everything that follows.

## üõ†Ô∏è CircadiaLux System Overview

### üß≠ Architecture at a Glance

![System Architecture of CircadiaLux showing ML pipeline, Supabase backend, IoT devices, and web dashboard](/circadialux/architectureDiagram.png)


### üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface

Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**, the web dashboard provides an intuitive interface designed specifically for healthcare professionals:

- Patient management with personalized profiles  
- Device monitoring and status overview 
- Secure role-based access (admin & caregiver roles)

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Backend

**Supabase** serves as our backend solution, delivering scalable, real-time infrastructure:

- üîê PostgreSQL database for storing patient data and lighting preferences  
- üîê Real-time authentication with role-based security  
- üì° Webhook triggers that automatically generate new lighting recommendations  
- ÔøΩÔ∏è API endpoints for seamless communication between components

### ü§ñ Machine Learning for Personalized Lighting

Our ML component uses a **Random Forest Regressor** model that achieves **96.2% accuracy** in predicting optimal lighting parameters. The system predict optimal lighting parameters for each patient based on:

- Age  
- Chronotype  
- Gender 
- Sleep information

We generate **48 lighting adjustments per day** (every 30 minutes), fine-tuned to:

- Color Temperature (CCT)  
- Brightness Intensity  

To avoid harsh transitions, we apply **smoothing algorithms** to create gradual, comfortable lighting shifts.

### üîå Embedded IoT Hardware

Each lighting controller is built around the **ESP32** microcontroller, equipped with:

- Dual-channel LED control (warm/cool) via MOSFETs  
- Color sensor feedback for accurate CCT/intensity reproduction  
- Custom WiFi management with user-friendly setup

## üåç Real-World Impact

The implications of CircadiaLux extend far beyond just better lighting:

### üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è For Patients
- **Improved sleep quality** through proper circadian entrainment  
- **Potentially faster recovery times** through optimized healing environments  
- **Reduced need for sleep medications** and sedatives  
- **Better overall comfort and well-being** during hospital stays  

### üè• For Healthcare Facilities
- **Energy savings** through intelligent brightness control   
- **Higher patient satisfaction** scores

## üß† Final Thoughts: Healing Through Light

**CircadiaLux isn‚Äôt just a lighting system‚Äîit‚Äôs a step toward more humane, intelligent healthcare environments.**

By combining embedded systems, ML, and design thinking, we created a system that supports patients not only physically‚Äîbut biologically and emotionally too.

> ‚ÄúWhen technology aligns with biology, it empowers healing.‚Äù

The future of healthcare lighting is **personalized**, **intelligent**, and **human-centered**‚Äîand CircadiaLux is helping build it, one patient room at a time.
